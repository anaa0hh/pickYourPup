        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Pick Your Pup was created by Christopher Chew, Ana Ortega and Autumn Curtis (left to right) out of their love for dogs and their passion for pet rescue and adoption. It is often the case that pets end up in a surrender or rescue situation because of lack of information about the breed and/or the necessary information about pet care. It is our hope that this tool will assist potential pet owners in finding a breed compatible with their lifestyle, which will be more fulfilling for both pet and owner. Although we only provide match information for purebreds, due to the inconsistent genetic nature of mixed breeds, we in no way value them more. In fact, mixed breeds often bring to the table a unique look and personality all their own! We hope that potential owners using this tool will take advantage of the links provided to connect them with breed specific rescue organizations for their matches. <bold>Woof.</bold>
